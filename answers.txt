Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: Using Git helps us have efficient version control. It allows you to track 
changes and collaborate easily with peers on coding projects. It also gives us a 
good way to manage different versions of files. This way, if we wanted to revert 
to old stages, it works!

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an example and how it might help.

Answer: Data science can be applied to the healthcare field to analyze patient data. 
For example, the field of predictive analytics can predict disease outbreaks by 
examining historical health records and environmental factors and analyzing them.

Q3: What is the difference between merging and rebasing?

Answer: Merging combines changes from different branches into one. On the other hand, 
rebasing rewrites the commit history to place changes on top of another branch.

Q4: What skills do you hope to improve during this course?

Answer: I hope to improve my data analysis, visualization, and Python and SQL/Pandas 
programming skills to become proficient in data science techniques and be able to 
hopefully apply them in the real-world one day.
